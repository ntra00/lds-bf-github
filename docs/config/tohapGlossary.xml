At this time the traditional Tibetan government and feudal-like estate system were ended and replaced with new political and administrative structures as well as a new class system. The "democratic reforms" primarily involved confiscating land, animals, and other property from the feudal landlord class and those who were involved in the rebellion and redistributing these to poor peasants.</def>

This large administrative unit was headed by one or two District Commissioners (dzongpön [rdzong dpon]) appointed by the Tibetan government in Lhasa. Typically there were one lay official and one monk official sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district.  They are roughly equivalent to counties (ch. xian) in the current system of administration. The system of dzong began during the time of the Phamodrupa Kings of Tibet in the late 14th century. At the end of the traditional system in 1959, there were approximately XX dzong in Tibet.</def>

               <def>[kadrung] Kadrung were important administrative aides to the Kashag Ministers. There were usually two of these, both aristocratic lay officials. Their job was to assist the ministers any way the mionisters needed, but their usual work involved writing whatever letters, documents, orders, recommendations the Kashag sent to the Dalai Lama and other offices and the edicts the Kashag sent to counties. By custom, the the seal of the Kashag could only be applied by the 2 Kadrung, even if the ministers were there. People of officials under the 5th rank had to sumbit their petitions first through the Kadrung (or kandrön). There were also two kandrön [bka' mgron] in the Kashag office. They were also aristocratic lay officials and generally were less powerful than the kadrung, handling lessor requests to the Kashag. Their office was called the Dröndrung khang [tib. mgron drung khang].</def>

However, he will meet with them for important issues (for example if the Dalai Lama has something to say to the Kashag).

               <def>Kadrung were important administrative aides to the Kashag Ministers. There were usually two of these, both aristocratic lay officials. Their job was to assist the ministers any way the mionisters needed, but their usual work involved writing whatever letters, documents, orders, recommendations the Kashag sent to the Dalai Lama and other offices and the edicts the Kashag sent to counties. By custom, the the seal of the Kashag could only be applied by the 2 Kadrung, even if the ministers were there. People of officials under the 5th rank had to sumbit their petitions first through the Kadrung (or kandrön). There were also two kandrön [bka' mgron] in the Kashag office. They were also aristocratic lay officials and generally were less powerful than the kadrung, handling lessor requests to the Kashag. Their office was called the Dröndrung khang [tib. mgron drung khang].</def>

From the peasant's perspective, it refered to his or her hereditary lord to whom he/she was obliged to provide corvée services or other taxes. In traditional Tibet, there were three main categories of lord: aristocratic lords, religious lords (monasteries or labrang), and the government as a lord. A person's link to a lord was hereditary and was passed on via parallel descent, that is to say, the sons of a couple belonged to the lord of the father and the daughters to the lord of his wife (if they had different lords).</def>

From the peasant's perspective, it refered to his or her hereditary lord to whom he/she was obliged to provide corvée services or other taxes.

A person's link to a lord was hereditary and was passed on via parallel descent, that is to say, the sons of a couple belonged to the lord of the father and the daughters to the lord of his wife (if they had different lords).</def>

               <def>[ngadag] The person or institution (monastery, labrang) that owned manorial estates and serfs. Sometimes this is translated as lord and sometimes as serf-owner. From the peasant's perspective, it refered to his or her hereditary lord to whom he/she was obliged to provide corvée services or other taxes. In traditional Tibet, there were three main categories of lord: aristocratic lords, religious lords (monasteries or labrang), and the government as a lord. A person's link to a lord was hereditary and was passed on via parallel descent, that is to say, the sons of a couple belonged to the lord of the father and the daughters to the lord of his wife (if they had different lords).</def>

               <def>[ngadag] The person or institution (monastery, labrang) that owned manorial estates and serfs. Sometimes this is translated as lord and sometimes as serf-owner. From the peasant's perspective, it refered to his or her hereditary lord to whom he/she was obliged to provide corvée services or other taxes. In traditional Tibet, there were three main categories of lord: aristocratic lords, religious lords (monasteries or labrang), and the government as a lord. A person's link to a lord was hereditary and was passed on via parallel descent, that is to say, the sons of a couple belonged to the lord of the father and the daughters to the lord of his wife (if they had different lords).</def>

These were servants summoned involuntarily from among a lord's serfs and who received food and clothing but not wages per se. Thus the servants in the manor house on an estate or in the lrod's house in the capital were normally Trenyog.</def>

Sön means seed, so the term sönkhe meant a khe of seed. This term was used to delimit the size of fields in Tibet so that a field whose size was said to be 3 sönkhe, was a field on which 3 khe of seed should be sown.</def>
